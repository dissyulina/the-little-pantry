## **Development Plane**

### **1. Strategy Plane** 

As The Little Pantry is a fictional business, a strategic UX research was done through: 
* Interviews with a few potential users.
* An interview with a zero-waste enthusiast.
* Online research of competitors (similar shops located in the same city), and news related to the rising of the plastic-free shop.

Below are the result of the comprehensive and detailed interviews and research that have been conducted.

   #### **Online Research**
   1. Customer Research  
       According to research by Afval Barometer from SUEZ (source: afvalgids.nl), 95% of Netherlands residents agree that separating the trash (into plastic, glass, paper, and the rest) is important, but only 60% do it. The Little Pantry is created as an alternative to a regular supermarket, so instead of separating the trash which requires more effort, we remove the packaging altogether.  

   2. Competitor Research  
       According to online research that the developer did, some similar businesses to The Little Pantry were found in Den Haag, The Netherlands.
