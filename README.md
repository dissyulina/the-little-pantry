## **Introduction**


Welcome to the website of The Little Pantry!

The Little Pantry is a small plastic-free grocery shop located in Den Haag, The Netherlands. In this shop, you can buy your daily food items, such as fruits, vegetables, pasta, dry spices, nuts, oats, coffee, etc, in any amount that you like or need. The website is a one-page website, it features an about page, products that the shop sells, step by step on how to shop, a contact form, and a find us section.

Please note that this company is fictional and was created for the Code Institute’s Milestone Project 1 as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. The requirements are to make a static front-end website, using HTML, CSS, and (optional) Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks.

## **Development Plane**
<br />  

### **1. Strategy Plane** 

As The Little Pantry is a fictional business, a strategic UX research was done through: 
* Interviews with a few potential users.
* An interview with a zero-waste enthusiast.
* Online research of competitors (similar shops located in the same city), and news related to the rising of the plastic-free shop.

Below are the result of the comprehensive and detailed interviews and research that have been conducted.

   #### **Online Research**
   1. Customer Research  
       According to research by Afval Barometer from SUEZ (source: afvalgids.nl), 95% of Netherlands residents agree that separating the trash (into plastic, glass, paper, and the rest) is important, but only 60% do it. The Little Pantry is created as an alternative to a regular supermarket, so instead of separating the trash which requires more effort, we remove the packaging altogether.  

   2. Competitor Research  
       According to online research that the developer did, some similar businesses to The Little Pantry were found in Den Haag, The Netherlands.  
         * [Lekkernasuh](https://lekkernassuh.org)  
         Lekkernassuh is a physical plastic/packaging-free shop, almost similar to The Little Pantry. However, they are located in a sports hall, and only opens for 3 hours, once every two weeks (on Saturday). It is more of a community market, and the workers are all volunteers, so it lacks a clean, modern, and professional feel to it.
         * Traditional Markets in Den Haag  
         There are also traditional markets in Den Haag, where you can buy fruits, vegetables, meat, etc. In this type of market, the food items are typically not in plastic packaging, so you can always shop plastic-free. However, as many traditional markets usually are, they don’t have a website and are lacking food items such as beans, grains, dry spices, etc. 
         * [Pieter Pot](https://www.pieter-pot.nl)  
         There’s also an online packaging-free shop, which has no physical shop. They deliver your grocery in glass jars (where you also pay for the jars), and at the next delivery you give the jars back (then you also get your money back). The website looks quite professional, but as I mentioned before, what they are lacking is a physical shop.

   The user's goal when visiting this website is to get comprehensive information about The Little Pantry, as a plastic-free / packaging-free grocery shop.  
<br />

   #### **Business Goals**
   The business concept itself is relatively new, therefore the website has to provide clear and relevant information about the buying process and what the customer can expect when they visit the shop. 
   - To create an online presence of the shop.
