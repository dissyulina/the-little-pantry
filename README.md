In this shop, you can buy your daily food items, such as fruits, vegetables, pasta, dry spices, nuts, oats, coffee, etc, in any amount that you like or need.

### Research
#### Customer Research
According to research by Afval Barometer from SUEZ (source: afvalgids.nl), 95% of The Netherlands residents agree that separating the trash (into plastic, glass, paper, and the rest) is important, but only 60% actually do it. This means 95% of the population in The Netherlands are environmentally conscious, but not all of them are willing to make an effort to do trash separating. In this huge potential market, The Little Pantry is created as an alternative to a regular supermarket, so instead of separating the trash which requires more effort, we remove the packaging altogether. It is also better for the environment.

The target customer is people (typically between 20-50) that are environmentally conscious, or interested in the environmental issue. 

#### Competitor Research


I found some similar business to The Little Pantry, in Den Haag, The Netherlands.

- Lekkernassuh (www.lekkernassuh.org)
	Lekkernassuh is a physical plastic/packaging-free shop, almost similar to The Little Pantry. However, they are located in a sports hall, and only opens for 3 hours, once every two weeks (on Saturday). It is more of a community market, and the workers are all volunteers, so it lacks a clean, modern, and professional feel to it.

- Traditional markets in Den Haag
	There are also traditional markets in Den Haag, where you can buy fruits, vegetables, meat, etc. In this type of market, the food items are typically not in plastic packaging, so you can always shop plastic-free. However, as many traditional markets usually are, they are lacking food items such as beans, grains, dry spices, etc.

- Pieter Pot
There’s also an online packaging-free shop, which has no physical shop. They deliver your grocery in glass jars (where you also pay for the jars), and at the next delivery you give the jars back (then you also get your money back). The website looks quite professional, but as I mentioned before, what they are lacking is a physical shop.
