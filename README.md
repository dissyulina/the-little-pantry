The website is one-page website, it features an about page, products that the shop sells, step by step on how to shop, a contact form, and a find us section. The goal of this project is to provide an informative website for customers and potential costumers to come visit and shop regularly at The Little Pantry.

Please note that this company is fictional and was created for the Code Instituteâ€™s Milestone Project 1 as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. It was developed using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Development modules.

### Business Goals

The business concept itself is relatively new (the first one in the The Hague, although not the first one in the world), therefore the website has to provide clear and relevant information about the buying process and what the costumer can expect when they visit the shop. 
The business goals of this website are:
- To introduce a plastic-free concept and the benefits to potential costumers.
- To provide a clear information on how it works.
- To draw enough interest of potential costumers to actually visit the shop.
- To create a customer engagement to the shop and to make The Daily Pantry as their regular choice for grocery shopping.
